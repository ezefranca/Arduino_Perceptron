# Arduino Perceptron

A [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) algorithm for machine learning in Arduino

## Usage

1. Create object class perceptron, e.g. perceptron p1(number of inputs);
2. Randomize weights,  p1.randomize();
3. In loop update inputs e.g. p1.inputs[0] = analogRead...; p1.inputs[2] = analogRead...
4. Make a guess store in a variable e.g. float guess = p1.feedForward();
5. Train: compared obtained (guess) with some desired e.g. p1.train(desired, obtained);


## Examples

1. *Learning_Color_NN* teaching an Arduino color using a color sensor
2. *playground_learn* teaching an [Adafruit Circuit Playgound] (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3000) how to get the right position using accelerometer.
3. *playground_learn_color* Adafruit Circuit Playground learning colors.
